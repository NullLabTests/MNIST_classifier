
# MNIST Classifier in Julia 📊🔢

Welcome to a simple neural network classifier for MNIST digits, implemented using Julia and the Flux.jl library. This project serves as an educational example to showcase Julia's capabilities in machine learning.

## Overview 🌟

This project:

- Uses the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.
- Employs a simple neural network model with Flux.jl.
- Demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Includes steps to save the model and prepare for GitHub integration.

## Installation 🔧

To run this project, you'll need:

- Julia (version 1.0 or higher)
- The following Julia packages:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Flux", "MLDatasets", "BSON"])

Usage 🚀
Download the Code: Clone or download this repository.
Run the Script:
From the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:
bash
julia mnist_classifier.jl
View Results:
The script will train the model, display accuracy, and save the trained model.

Code Structure 📂
mnist_classifier.jl: The main script containing:
